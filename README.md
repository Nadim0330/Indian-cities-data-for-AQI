# 🗂️ Air Quality Dataset: Indian Cities Classification

## 📄 Dataset Description

We extracted the dataset from the WAQI platform (https://aqicn.org/here/) and performed necessary modifications, including filtering and preprocessing, to produce a clean, structured dataset suitable for air quality analysis and machine learning tasks. This dataset includes 43 Indian cities, categorized by AQI variability into Low, Moderate, and High levels.

The historical air quality data was sourced from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) platform, which compiles real-time and historical data from ground-based monitoring stations managed by global Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs). In areas lacking such stations, WAQI supplements the data using satellite-based estimates, particularly from NASA.
